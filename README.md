# PyOpenCL Inline Comments Tutorial

An introduction to parallel computation with Python using OpenCL and OpenGL.

This tutorial is a numbered series of files.  Each file is a program with extensive inline comments.

## Why inline comments?

IMHO comments should be avoided in production code - but comments add a lot to a tutorial.  Commenting every line forces the author to slow down and explain each bit of code in a way that a diligent reader can understand.  It is important to minimize the number of times a reader has to turn away and look something up.
