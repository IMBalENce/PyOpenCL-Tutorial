'''The purpose of this document will be to ask the host system everything
about the context, buffers, devices, etc.

I want to know how to ask the OpenCL API for some answers about itself,
that can be used to get a solid sense of the system.

At the end of this document, I want to use the ansers I get to make a slightly
more complicated kernel.

The next kernel OpenCL/OpenGL will show some real complexity and try to squeeze
real performance out of the GPU.
