# PyOpenCL Inline Comments Tutorial

Welcome to an introduction to parallel computation with Python and OpenCL.  This tutorial is composed of a numbered series of PyOpenCL scripts - each with extensive inline comments.

### About The Comments

This tutorial is an expiriment in code education.  The idea is that commenting each line will force the author to slow down and use plain english to explain every detail in a way that a diligent reader can understand.

I have tried to write the code and the comments in a way that they could be separated and each one would still tell the complete story of what is going on.  With two sources of information, hopefully readers will seldom have to break focus and look something up.

### About The Tutorial

PyOpenCL is a tool that is worth learning.  Python allows exceptional clarity-of-expression while OpenCL provides access to all the power modern hardware can deliver.  Together these two languages are like a double-bladed lightsaber in a world full of butter knives.
