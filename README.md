# PyOpenCL Inline Comments Tutorial

This is an introduction to parallel computation with Python and OpenCL.  The tutorial is composed of a numbered series of files.  Each file contains an entire program with extensive inline comments.

## Why inline comments?

Comments can encourage bad style in production code, but they add a lot to a tutorial.  Commenting each line forces the author to slow down and explain every detail in a way that a diligent reader can understand.

I have tried to write the code and the comments in a way that they could be separated and each one would still tell the complete story of what is going on.  With two sources of information, hopefully readers will seldom have to break focus and look something up.

## Why are some lines super-long?

This tutorial does not follow PEP 8's recommendation of 79 characters per-line because there are long comments mixed in with the code.  It is best to turn on code-wrap in your editor, while reading this tutorial.
