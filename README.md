# PyOpenCL Inline Comments Tutorial

An introduction to parallel computation on the GPU with Python and OpenCL.  This tutorial is a numbered series of files.  Each file contains an entire program with extensive inline comments.

### Why inline comments?

Comments can encourage bad style in production code, but they add a lot to a tutorial.  Commenting each line forces the author to slow down and explain every detail in a way that a diligent reader can understand.

I have tried to write the code and the comments in a way that they could be separated and each one would still tell the complete story of what is going on.  With two sources of information, hopefully readers will seldom have to break focus and look something up.

### Why are some lines super-long?

Use code-wrap in your editor.  I know PEP 8 says to limit lines to 79 characters, but I consider this recommendation dated.
