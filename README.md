# PyOpenCL Inline Comments Tutorial

An introduction to parallel computation with Python using OpenCL and OpenGL.

This tutorial is a numbered series of files - all code with extensive inline comments.

## Why inline comments?

I am not a fan of comments in production code, but comments are great for a tutorial. Commenting every line forces the author to slow down explain each line in a way that a diligent reader can understand.  It is very important to minimize the number of times a reader not has to turn away and look something up.
